# Supermarket-Sim-Assignment (Header)
This is for my Advanced Programming Individual Assignment.

## Scenario: (Subheader)
A large supermarket chain wishes to develop an in-house supermarket simulation to help optimise the flow of customers through the store. 

## Aim: 
Make it easy for key staff within the organisation to represent the components of a supermarket scenario and run a simulation based
on various configurations in order to maximise the efficiency of the store.

The software artefact will support the behaviour of a typical shopping experience: 

### Shoppers
•	enter the store; 
•	pick-up a basket; 
•	select products from the store; 
•	place products in the basket; 
•	join a queue at the tills; 
•	wait to be served;
•	be served; 
•	bag products
•	leave the store. 

### Cashier 
•	will clock on and off as a till in opened or closed; How to implement clock in and clock off?
•	serve the next customer in the queue; 
•	log each product in the basket 
•	and wait for the next customer
